<p>I'm currently a junior Rails software developer at <a href="https://www.annkissam.com/">Annkissam</a>, a small (but quickly growing!) software company in Boston, MA that builds software that helps mission-driven organizations such as non-profits help others. I'm passionate about using code for social good (the things we make should do good, right?) and education. And for <a href="http://scausey.github.io/projects/">fun things</a>.</p>

<p>I graduated in May of 2017 from <a href="https://www.smith.edu/">Smith College</a> in Northampton, Massachusetts with a BA in computer science. While at Smith, I received a prestigious <a href="http://www.fulbright.ca/programs/killam-fellowships.html">Killiam Fellowship</a>, and studied at York University in Toronto, Ontario, Canada in Fall of 2015; then in Spring of 2016, I studied abroad at AIT Budapest in Budapest, Hungary. I also was on the Dean's List at Smith College for the 2016-2017 school year.</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		I'm drawn to stories, so I was once well-versed in children's and YA literature, but now I read <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3955921-samantha-louise">read</a> a more adult fantasy and sci-fi (Joe Abercrombie is my cuppa tea); and like playing story-driven <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/id/enigmajane/">video games and D&D</a>. I write fiction sometimes (but that's a secret).
	</li>
	<li>
		I did a <a href="https://scausey.github.io/8-thoughts-on-my-vipassana-experience/">10-day silent Vipassana meditation intensive</a> in Western Mass in early September 2019. It was as hard as people say it is.
	</li>
	<li>
		I use almost all of my spare time to cook and bake. I frequent <a href="https://www.177milkstreet.com/">Milk Street</a>, <a href="https://food52.com/">Food52</a>, and <a href="https://smittenkitchen.com/">Smitten Kitchen</a>. I'd frequent <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/">NYT Cooking</a> if it wasn't $5 or $6 a month, but it's not so I don't. &macr;\_(ãƒ„)_/&macr; I've recently started dreaming up my own recipes.

	<li>
		I love cake and <a href="http://daubnercukraszda.hu/">Daubner in Budapest</a> is THE BEST!

	<li>
		RIP Anthony Bourdain who made travel what it should be: a hedonistic cocktail of history, politics, food, and actually <i>talking</i> to people, goddamnit.
