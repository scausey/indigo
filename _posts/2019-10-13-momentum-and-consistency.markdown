description: How a small browser extension project
---

I have years upon years of story ideas in various different places and in the same way I have years (but still a decent amount) of ideas for coding projects. Web applications, mobile applications, Javascript games, website designs, and to a smaller extent hardware projects.

One of these ideas made use of browsing history. A grand project. Recently, I scoped the idea into a smaller "stepping stone" project that involves Wikipedia browser history. And because I had didn't have much of an idea how to approach that project, I broke it down again.

Somehow that breaking down translated to a Chrome extension I started working on half a year ago.

The practice extension removed the average rating and individual ratings from book reviews on Goodreads. Days of  whether or not I wanted to read a book being influenced by the book's average rating and individual ratings would be no more. I would return to the days of judging a book for myself based on its cover and description.

This project is extremely small, something **I should have spent an entire day to complete it as opposed to spending thirty minutes on it, putting down, and then several months later trying to pick up again**. Which of course involves time spent relearning how browser extensions are structured, how to test my code, and how I wrote mine (which involves criticizing it and improving it). Time I wouldn't have had to spend on this small project if I'd just spent an hour or two more several months ago finishing it.

This is a reminder for myself that **I'm happiest coding when I break projects down into smaller, set (yet flexible) steps that I commit to working on consistently every day. I'm happiest building momentum through consistent patterns**.
