description: A few musings on being SCRUM master.
---

Because of a dislike of authority I shy away from leadership positions, including "master" of anything. But we needed a SCRUM master and the question was phrased not as "will you be SCRUM master", but instead as "we need help and we think you can help") so here I am at the end of my first week as a SCRUM master.

I was afraid of taking a leadership/middle management type position, but it turns out being a **SCRUM master is at its core more of a *servant* leadership position**. Stress on the "servant" part of that: I protect the team from taking on more than they can handle, work to remove impediments to work getting finished, and ask developers and PMs "how can I help?" when tickets get stuck. I don't tell them how they should do their work.

Before I started the new sub-role, I knew that I would have to develop better communication and people skills. The silly thing though is **I didn't realize the acute importance of empathetical and analytical listening**. I respect and admire people who listen closely, respond thoughtfully and carefully, and then turn the interaction into positive change the most. So in my new sub-role, I try to mimic their thoughtfulness. There are no generic SCRUM master questions: Instead, I listen closely, give myself a few moments to really think, and then follow up with questions and responses that clear up ambiguity, and/or lead to productive team discussions.

Which brings me to my last realization: After my first few team discussions, **I became more aware that my position as SCRUM master, and therefore a team "leader", gave my opinions more weight in the eyes of team members**, regardless of whether or not my opinion had to do with SCRUM or with how we should approach a client's request when building out a feature. In the readings I've done so far, my understanding is that SCRUM master should not give their opinions on anything but how SCRUM is used, but because I'm still primarily a developer, the SCRUM master sub-role gets a bit ambiguous. I have to be extremely sensitive to the way my opinions could affect the team into making decisions that should be made by everyone together.
